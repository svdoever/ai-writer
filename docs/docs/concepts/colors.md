# Colors

## Utilizing Colors for Enhanced Clarity

In order to provide a clear and concise explanation of AI Writer, we will employ the use of colors within our diagrams, the text content in the documentation, and even in the output generated by AI Writer itself. By incorporating colors, our objective is to aid users in comprehending the distinct components and functionalities of AI Writer with ease.

It is important to note that while colors serve as an effective means of improving visual comprehension, they are not inherently a part of AI Writer's underlying structure or design. Instead, they are simply a teaching tool incorporated to provide a more straightforward understanding of the system.

The following colors are used:

- <span style={{color: "blue"}}>Blue</span> - The options (parameters) that you can set for a recipe, and the data it turns into and that is used as input to AI Writer to generate the prompt based on the prompt template. It can be text, but also data in JSON format.

- <span style={{color: "gray"}}>Gray</span> - The prompt template.

- <span style={{color: "orange"}}>Orange</span> - The prompt, which is the result of replacing the variables in the prompt template with data.

- <span style={{color: "green"}}>Green</span> - The completion, or output of AI Writer. This is the content that is generated by AI Writer. It can be text, but also data in JSON format.
