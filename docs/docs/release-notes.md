# Release notes

## Introduction

In the AI Writer release notes you can see what new features become available with each version.

### 1.0.45

It is now possible to use recipes directly from code, instead of doing a `shell.exec()` to execute AI Writer though the CLI. The `ai-writer` npm package now provides both a CLI and a function `executeRecipe()` that can be imported from the `ai-writer` package. See [Execute from code](advanced/executing-a-recipe-from-code) for more information.

### 1.0.44

Baseline version. Release notes will start from here.
