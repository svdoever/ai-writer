# Installation

## Supported environments

AI Writer is written in JavaScript (Node.js) and can be used on any platform that supports Node.js. It has been tested on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Prerequisite

AI Writer requires Node.js to run. Check if you have Node.js installed on your computer by running `node -v` in your terminal. If you don't have Node.js installed, install it from [here](https://nodejs.org). Make sure you have version **18.16.0 LTS** installed.

> Note: if you have another version of Node.js, consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), the Node version manager, which allows you to easily switch between different versions of Node.js.
