# Source control

Ensure your project is safe.


When a new project is created with AI Writer, it is best to store the project in a source control system like Git. This allows you to track changes to your project and to collaborate with others.

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system. It allows you to track changes to your project and to collaborate with others. Git is used by many software developers to track changes to their code, and the same principles can be applied to AI Writer projects. Projects, like the one created with AI Writer, can be stored in a Git repository.   

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a hosting platform for Git repositories. It allows you to store your Git repositories in the cloud and to collaborate with others. GitHub is used by many software developers to host their code, and it is adviced to host AI Writer projects on GitHub as well.

If you don't have a GitHub account yet, sign up on the homepage. If you already have a GitHub account, sign in.
On you GitHub homepage, you can create a new repository by clicking the "+" button in the upper-right corner.

A repository can either be public or private. A public repository is visible to everyone, while a private repository is only visible to you and the people you share it with.
