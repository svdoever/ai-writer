# The AI Writer

AI Writer is a tool that can be used to generate content using AI. It is a command line tool that can be used to generate content based on a recipe. A recipe is a set of instructions or guidelines that describe how to prepare or make something, typically a dish of prepared food, but in our case: content. It serves as a roadmap, providing detailed steps that need to be followed to achieve the desired result.

## How does it work?

The following diagram shows the different parts of AI Writer and how they work together.
