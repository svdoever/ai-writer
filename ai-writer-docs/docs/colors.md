To explain AI Writer we will use colors, both in the diagrams and texts in the documentation, as in the output of AI Writer. The colors are used to make it easier to understand the different parts of AI Writer. The colors are not part of AI Writer, they are just used to make it easier to understand.

The following colors are used:

- **Blue** - The options (parameters) that you can set for a recipe, and the data it turns into and that is used as input to AI Writer to generate the prompt based on the prompt template. It can be text, but also data in JSON format.

- **Gray** - The prompt template.

- **Yellow** - The prompt, which is the result of replacing the variables in the prompt template with data.

- **Green** - The completion, or output of AI Writer. This is the content that is generated by AI Writer. It can be text, but also data in JSON format.
